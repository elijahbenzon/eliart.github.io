          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Elijah Benzon, also known as Eli, strives to explore all different media of art. Most of his early work consisted
            mostly of two-dimensional art, especially graphite drawings. When he started to take art classes in college, Elijah
            experimented with three-dimensional art, using materials such as wood, metal, plaster, and glass and with electronic
            media including Illustrator and Photoshop. In college, Elijah intertwined personal struggles and societal concerns
            into his artwork. In the future, Elijah hopes to further define his artist statement and to use his artwork to
            inspire others. </p>
          <p>
          Born and raised in Fort Myers, Florida, Elijah is currently a fourth-year undergraduate student in the University
          of Miami. In Miami, he studies biology, psychology, and art and participates in two student-led organizations: the
          Canes Emergency Response Team and the Locked Dance Team. Elijah loves incorporating his travel experiences and
          interest in different cultures in his artwork. He has traveled to many countries, including Canada, Peru, the Bahamas,
          the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand.
