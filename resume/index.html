        My name is Elijah Benzon (also known by Eli), and I am currently a senior at the University of Miami.
        I am double majoring in biology and psychology, while also minoring in chemistry and art. I have been
        a research assistant with the Early Head Start University Partnership Laboratory, Vice President of Operations for
        the Canes Emergency Response Team, and Social Media Chair for the Locked Dance Team. I have also been on three mission
        trips, two in Peru and one in the Philippines Islands, and a community service trip to Washington D.C. During my free
        time, I enjoy swimming, playing video games, making art, and hanging out with friends.
