      <p>
        Hello! I am Elijah Benzon, through I mostly go by Eli. If I had to describe my passions in three words, they
        would be: to learn, to teach, and to be creative. As an undergraduate student studying biology, psychology, chemistry,
        and art at the University of Miami, I applied these passions in whatever I could. I loved to learn about the
        world around us, whether through a research trip the Everglades or joining the Locked Dance Team. With respect to
        teaching, I taught emergency response as the Vice President of Operations for the Canes Emergency
        Response Team and participated as a research assistant with the Early Head Start University Partnership Laboratory
        at the University of Miami. Art has always been a pastime of mine, and I like to intertwine personal struggles
        and societal concerns into his artwork. I hope to use my artwork to inspire others.
